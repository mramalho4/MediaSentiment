# MediaSentiment Package

The MediaSentiment package provides a set of functions to assist in sentiment analysis tasks. These functions are designed to preprocess text data, tokenize text into individual words or tokens, calculate word frequency, identify keywords, and perform basic sentiment analysis for media content.

## Installation

You can install the MediaSentiment package from GitHub using the devtools package. First, make sure you have devtools installed:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then, install MediaSentiment from GitHub:

```R
devtools::install_github("your_username/MediaSentiment")
```

## Functions

### 1. clean_text()

This function cleans text data by removing special characters, numbers, and extra white spaces.

### 2. tokenize_text()

This function tokenizes the text into individual words or tokens.

### 3. calculate_word_frequency()

This function calculates the frequency of each word in the text.

### 4. find_keywords()

This function identifies keywords in the text based on their frequency or relevance.

### 5. sentiment_analysis()

This function performs sentiment analysis on text data.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use the functions provided by the MediaSentiment package:

```R
# Clean text
cleaned_text <- clean_text("Sample text with special characters: !@#$%^&*()")
print(cleaned_text)

# Tokenize text
tokens <- tokenize_text("This is a sample sentence.")
print(tokens)

# Calculate word frequency
word_freq <- calculate_word_frequency("This is a sample sentence. This sentence is a sample.")
print(word_freq)

# Find keywords
keywords <- find_keywords("This is a sample sentence. Sample sentence contains sample words.")
print(keywords)

# Perform sentiment analysis
sentiment <- sentiment_analysis("This is a positive sentence.")
print(sentiment)
```
